Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is a systematic application of engineering principles to design, design, test and maintain a software.
It ensures quality and reliability especially when delivering the products since it applies systematic practices to solve complex problems.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The 1968 NATO Software engineering Conference, its when the systematic engineering practices begun.
The Introduction of the waterfall model in 1979s, this was the first formalized development methodologies.
The adoption of Agile methodologies and continous Evaluation,it has allowed constant reaccess of the product and development process and identifying issues early.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning, it involves gathering and analyzing the requirements for the software.
Feasibility, this evaluates the technical, operational and financial requirements for the project.
System design, it involves creating the software's blueprint based on the gathered requirements.
Coding, the developers translate the design into actual code.
Testing, here the code undergoes testing to identify the bugs and errors.
Implementation, once tested the software is made accessible to the end-user.
Maintenance, this ensures the software remains functional and secure.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodologyis a sequential approach where the development process flows through a set of pre-defined approaches,like construction projects
while Agile methodologies is adaptable to changes allowing for requirement modificaton, like in building mobile applicatons.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer is responsible for designing, coding and implementing the projects requirements,
Quality Assuarance Engineer is resposible for ensuring that the softaware meets the required quality standards.
Project Manager is responsible for supervisoring the projects progress.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDE is a single application that combines various tools needed to test and debug the code,like Visual Studio code
VSC helps keep track of every changes made allowing multiple developers to collaborate like Github.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Keeping up with the industry changes.
Balancing speed and accuracy.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing. This is testing small parts of the code. It helps in catching bugs early.
intergration testing. Tests how different modules work together after unit testing. It identifies issues that may arise when separate parts interact.
System testing. It tests the complete software system as a whole. It confirms that the entire system works correctly.
Acceptance testing. It's conducted from the user's and client's perspective. It ensures the final product alings with the requirement.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Is the practice of designing inputs to guide AI models towards generating desired output.
It provides clear and precise prompts, users can streamline their interactions with AI models.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
When we instruct the AI to tell us something interesting, it's wide and not focused on something, but when we instruct it to tell us an interesting geographical fact in Kenya,it will provide the information in-depth.
This is important because by simplifying the vagueness, the AI models not only gives us a precise feedback but also saves the information and uses it to give suggestions.
